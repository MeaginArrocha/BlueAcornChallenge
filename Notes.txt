Notes:

Things that would be fixed in later development:

+ Shorten code : I have a lot of resused code
+ Borders around table
+ Symmetrical table
+ Get DESC - descending to work
+ Change ifDiscount to "yes" or "no" equals instead of 1 or 0
+ add discounts for items and not just pets
+ add feedback message for when filter comes up empty - like when you enter bob for a name
+ ability to filter with description if word is included in description instead of it being equal to
